Import data from a spreadsheet (.csv file format) and display it in a sortable HTML table.


== Description ==

CSV to SortTable is great for anyone who keeps track of important information using a spreadsheet. It could be used for product catalogs, inventory lists, or even leaderboards in a competition.


= How To Use =

Insert a sortable table into any page or post using this shortcode:

`[csv src=http://example.com/myfile.csv]`

The result will be a beautiful, semantically-correct HTML table populated with the contents of your file.


= Optional Features =

This plugin automatically does a few things for you, all of which can be disabled:

1. Adds CSS to the table, to make it look nice.
2. Converts image file URLs into clickable image links.
3. Converts some other file URLs into clickable file-type icons (.doc, .pdf, .ppt, .xls, .zip).

To disable any of these features, use the `disable` shortcode attribute:

`[csv src=http://example.com/myfile.csv disable=css]`
`[csv src=http://example.com/myfile.csv disable=icons,images]`
`[csv src=http://example.com/myfile.csv disable=all]`

The first shortcode would just disable the plugin CSS; the second would disable both icons and images; and the third would disable all features. You can disable any combination using a comma-separated list.


= Group Classes =

Let's say you have a table with three columns: Item, Description and Type. You want all table rows of the same Type to have the same CSS class, so you can highlight them in different colors or modify them all at once with JavaScript.

This can be done by assigning a column number to the `group` shortcode attribute, like this:

`[csv src=http://example.com/myfile.csv group=3]`

The result would be a special class assigned to each table row based on the value of the third column.


= Sorting Options =

Most table data can be sorted alphabetically, but you may have numbers, dates or columns that should not be sortable. To change the sorting rules for one or more columns, use the following shortcode attributes.

`[csv src=http://example.com/myfile.csv number=2]`
`[csv src=http://example.com/myfile.csv date=3]`
`[csv src=http://example.com/myfile.csv unsortable=4,5,6]`

The values can be a single column number, or multiple column numbers in a comma-separated list.


== Installation ==

1. Install and activate the plugin via `WP-Admin > Plugins`.
2. Add shortcode to a post or page: `[csv src=http://example.com/data.csv]`.
3. Use optional shortcode attributes to modify table behavior (see description).

== Credits ==

This plugin utilizes some excellent open source scripts, functions and images whose creators deserve to be recognized.

1. Stuart Langridge wrote [sorttable.js], the JavaScript that inspired this plugin and makes it possible to sort tables by clicking on the column headers.
2. V.Krishn wrote a handy [PHP function] that enables users of PHP < 5.3 to utilize the `str_getcsv()` function that powers this plugin.
3. Blake Knight created the beautiful [file type icons] used in this plugin and made them free for all.
